# insta viral

Quick, ugly failed experiment where I tried to interact with someone on Twitter, 
change the profiles user name via API, then engage another tweet, in hopes of 
triggering multiple push notifications to the targets phone. Unfortunately it didn't 
produce any push notifications and was quickly picked up as spam :disappointed:. This repo will serve
as a placeholder for more experiments attempting to create the illusion of virality.
